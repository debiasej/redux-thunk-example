Redux Thunk Example

Simple example to test Redux Thunk.

This project has been developed to practice my skills with React, Redux and Redux Thunk.

Getting Started

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start webpack server with the following:

    > git clone https://github.com/debiasej/redux-thunk-example.git
    > cd redux-thunk-example
    > npm install
    > npm start
This is an example created in the Stephen Grider's course: Modern React with Redux that have been modified by me.
